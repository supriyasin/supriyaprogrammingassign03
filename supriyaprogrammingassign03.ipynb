    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Here, we will learn to write a Python program through which we can check if the \n",
    "   given number is positive, zero, or negative.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Positive Numbers: A number is said to be positive if the number has a value greater \n",
    "   than 0, like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, etc. All the natural numbers are positive numbers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Negative Numbers: If a given number has a value less than 0 like -1, -2, -3, -5, -7, -9, -11, -13, etc., \n",
    "   then we can say that the given number is a negative number. Only rational and integer type numbers can \n",
    "   have negative values or numbers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       # Default function to run if else condition  \n",
    "    def NumberCheck(a):   \n",
    "        # Checking if the number is positive  \n",
    "        if a > 0:   \n",
    "            print(\"Number given by you is Positive\")   \n",
    "        # Checking if the number is negative   \n",

    "    \n",
    "    We have used a nested if else condition in the program to check the number. When the user gives an \n",
